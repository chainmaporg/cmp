Best Day Ever
In early November, Overstock.com stock saw its best day ever, jumping nearly 31% on a bullish   research note from Davidson’s Tom Forte, who predicted over 60% upside in shares. The analyst highlighted Overstock’s third-quarter earnings call, in which management indicated the platform could get rid of its home goods e-commerce segment to double down on the world’s most popular cryptocurrency bitcoin, which it handles via its Medici Ventures division.
Over the past few months, Overstock’s gains have picked up momentum on news that the retailer is planning to launch of licensed digital coin trading platform through its subsidiary tZero and raise funds through an initial coin offering . The company has been accepting bitcoin as payment since 2014. (See also: People Are Mortgaging Their Houses to Buy Bitcoin. )
