XRP , founded by Ripple, has overtaken bitcoin cash as the third-largest digital currency by market cap.

Ripple’s XRP cryptocurrency has seen a tremendous gain of 202% since December 9, propelling it to a market cap of $29.77 billion and making it the t hird-largest digital currency. It trails just  bitcoin and Ethereum , according to CoinMarketCap.com .
Founded in 2012 by what was then known as Ripple Labs, XRP aims to use blockchain technology to speed up cross-border money transfers and bank settlements. Currently, most of those transactions are facilitated on Swift, a much older network that can often take days to send money internationally, with high fees.

"I think a lot of this is simply the market better understanding the realities of digital assets performance (speed, throughput etc)," Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse told Business Insider on Wednesday. "There is - appropriately - a lot of excitement about the potential - but XRP is very uniquely positioned to actually be able to deliver on the promise."
