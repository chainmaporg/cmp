If you had a fortune in bitcoins, what would you do with it?
One Bitcoin whale (a term often used for someone who owns a lot of bitcoins) has decided to simply give most of it away to charities.
The anonymous benefactor announced his intentions on Reddit , and launched a site for this endeavor which he had called the Pineapple Fund .¬†

"I remember starting at bitcoin a few years ago. (...) Bitcoin has changed my life, and I have far more money than I can ever spend. My aims, goals, and motivations in life have nothing to do with having XX million or being the mega rich. So I'm doing something else: donating the majority of my bitcoins to charitable causes. I'm calling it üçç The Pineapple Fund," he wrote on Reddit.¬†
According to its website, the fund is donating to worthy charities, preferably registered, and not individuals, but exceptions may be made in "exceptional circumstances."¬†
The fund totals 5,057 bitcoins, which is about $86.4 million at today's prices, and it represents the majority of the owner's cryptocurrency holdings.¬†
Of course, with the benefactor being anonymous, it's hard to divulge his or her true intentions, but the Bitcoin address associated with the fund indeed had a balance of 5,058 bitcoins and has sent out a total of 228 bitcoins so far.¬†
So far, the Pineapple Fund has donated $1 million to Watsi , The Water Project , the EFF and Maps , as well as $500,000 to the BitGive foundation.¬†
I'm extremely grateful for the support @watsi has received from the Pineapple Fund. Their btc is going to help a lot of patients access healthcare. https://t.co/ZkfBMZt4pX

So why do all this and remain anonymous? The fund's creator has an interesting explanation in the FAQ.¬†
"The more bitcoin goes up, the more worried I am of my safety. I'd like to live a very low profile life, and most people in my life don't even know the magnitude of bitcoins I have," he wrote.¬†
Correction: This article initially said the donor's bitcoins were worth $86.4 billion. They're actually worth $86.4 million.
