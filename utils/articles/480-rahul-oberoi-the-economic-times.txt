Ripple was founded by Jed McCaleb in 2012. According to a report by Deutsche Bank Wealth Management, the principle of ripple is the verification of debentures. The account balances and also creditor-debtor relations are accessible for every user within the network.
But, different from bitcoin, the generation of ripple coins is not possible through mining.
The currency is only issued by ripple Labs itself. To avoid inflation the amount of ripple units is limited to 100 billion, with 99 billion already generated and around 55 billion distributed to the users. “Seen from this angle, Ripple Labs is only a digital bank. Power and control lies here with the company, not the users,” said Deutsche Bank Wealth Management in a report.
