Coinbase is a website where you can buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereal and Litecoin.

Lee’s aim was never to compete with bitcoin but create something that would compliment the leading cryptocurrency. 
He said: “The vision is always I wanted litecoin to complement bitcoin — not compete. 
“Bitcoin can be used for like moving millions of dollars between banks, buying houses, buying cars. It’s really secure… litecoin can be used for cheaper things.”
Litecoin is also known to have an easier mining process, requiring hardware that is more widely available.
