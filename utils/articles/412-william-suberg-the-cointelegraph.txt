Blockchain platform Waves is gearing up to release its “totally redesigned” version 1.0 Wednesday after an 18-month development phase.
A press release issued Wednesday gives extensive details of the token launcher and wallet’s redesign, something Waves alleges places greater emphasis on user-friendliness.
Preparations surrounding the release began last month after a stress test of the forthcoming new technology called Waves NG was completed.
Waves NG aims to address the issue of Blockchain reliability under heavy loads, occurring during events such as token distribution .
Waves has made advances in its native jurisdiction this year, achieving regulatory prominence through partnering to support the Moscow Stock Exchange at a time when the country’s long-term angle on Blockchain and cryptocurrency remained uncertain . The platform has also made inroads internationally.
As the country creates a dedicated Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Association, open attitudes to Blockchain, in contrast to Bitcoin and others, are combining with authorities’ desire to attract European investment, especially in the mining arena.
