Welcome to the latest free Telegraph It's Your Money podcast, which helps you navigate your finances and make the most of your money.
This week we talk to a first-time Bitcoin investor who has put half his money in cryptocurrency, about the rollercoaster ride – and how he will decide to sell.
We also talk about why people are unwittingly paying £50 a month for subscriptions they don't want, and whether the "Santa Rally" in investment markets is going to make us richer this month.
Finally, we look at what we can learn from Charles Dickens's approach to money – and how he left a £10m inheritance.
