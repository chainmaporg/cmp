Bitcoin fell as low as $13,000 on Sunday but has been steadily recovering ground throughout the week.
Bitcoin has now surged over 1,500% so far this year. The recent search has been driven by the launch of bitcoin futures contracts on Sunday, which has given institutional investors access to the new asset. Bitcoin futures sold by Cboe currently have bitcoin ending January at $18,500.00.
