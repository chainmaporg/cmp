Japanese Internet Services Firm Planning Pilot Program to Pay Portion of Employee Salaries in Bitcoin
Japanese company GMO Internet has announced that they are introducing a system in which employees of the company can receive a portion of their salary in Bitcoin (BTC/USD) .
According to a translated version of their press release , their goal in the process is to spread awareness and help support cryptocurrency. The plan is set to go into a test environment starting in February of 2018, and will eventually expand to the rest of the company upon the success of the pilot program.
GMO Internet provides a wide range of web services and does, in fact, have a Bitcoin exchange as one of their offerings. They originally began their exchange business back in May, before Japan began officially recognizing cryptocurrency exchanges.
The company is offering a bonus that is to be included for any employee willing to take the associated risks with accepting a portion of their salary in the volatile cryptocurrency.
Japan is one of the leading countries when it comes to the adoption of cryptocurrency. Back in April, Japan recognized Bitcoin as a form of legal tender . A few months later in September, Japan’s FSA (Financial Services Agency) officially recognized 11 registered cryptocurrency exchanges , which came with its own set of requirements.
GMO Internet is also planning to launch a token sale in 2018, which will support their mining board development business. They plan on trading their cryptocurrency against Bitcoin , have a cloud mining business, and also work on manufacturing computing equipment meant for cryptocurrency mining.
