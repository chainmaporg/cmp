Bitcoin futures maintained a healthy margin over the value of bitcoin itself Wednesday morning. Here are some headlines from around the world of cryptocurrency:
• Australia’s central banker chief is worried about a “ speculative mania ,” according to Reuters, while in South Korea, regulators are considering ways to rein it in -- including, potentially, taxing capital gains on sales in the digital asset. In India, Bloomberg reported, tax officials are examining transactions at some bitcoin exchanges.
• Demand for futures has also meant demand for bitcoin, often from institutions hedging futures positions. That means a number of exchanges are seeing booming volume -- and some, according to Barron’s Avi Salzman, are struggling to keep up .
• Bloomberg’s Stephen Gandel wonders what will happen when the first Cboe contract expires in January .
• Some observers now wonder openly whether North Korea is actively mining or even stealing bitcoin via hacking. “It is a fact that North Korea has been attacking virtual currency exchanges,” a South Korean internet security official told CNN.
• Hedge Fund Research, a hedge fund data and analysis company, launched a pair of indexes that track funds that are dedicated to blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, MarketWatch reports.
Looking ahead, CME Group will launch its own bitcoin futures next week, following this week’s debut from the Cboe. That points us toward one more story: A New York Times columnist who in 2013 bought and sold a bitcoin, declaring it “all but dead,” changed his tone .
Why? Five reasons, according to Kevin Roose: the last being his mistaken bet that Wall Street would steer clear of it. As more trading opportunities are set to hit the market , that particular nail appears to have been hammered into the coffin with authority.
