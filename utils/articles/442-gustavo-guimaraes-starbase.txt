Since Starbase concluded its crowdsale last month, the team has been hard at work, and shifted its engineering focus towards the creation of the Starbase platform.
With this objective, team members flew in to join the CEO, CTO and COO in Tokyo and hashed out plans for the first quarter of 2018.
Team meets in Tokyo in December. Many nationalities are represented within Starbase.
The alpha release is scheduled for the end of February 2018. We have already had enquiries for projects who wish use the platform. We will be doing pre-registration and selection of first projects in January, so if your project wants to be featured on the Starbase platform, please approach us at info@starbase.co with information on your project. Once the platform is released, you will be able to register projects directly on the platform.
On the same note, we are giving a short demo presentation to the 4th Global Blockchain Tour on the 19th of December. This tour is comprised of Chinese delegates who are visiting Japanese Blockchain companies. For a sneak peek at what we are demoing, check this gif ;-)
Look at this beauty! First steps.
We are also hiring . We need people to implement the Starbase vision. If you want to participate in the crypto future, as well as get paid in crypto, contact us via the angelList job posts. We are on-boarding two new engineers in the following weeks and welcome more applications.
We are looking forward to a successful 2018 and the launch of Starbase!
