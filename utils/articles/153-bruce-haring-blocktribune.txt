Bitcoin Holds, Ripple Explodes In Today’s Crypto Markets
Investing , News | December 14, 2017 By: Bruce Haring
Bitcoin appears to be in a holding pattern this week, as the market digests the spectacular run that saw it more than double in price in a short time frame. Today saw BTC holding in the $16,000 range, down slightly but not in any danger of significant plunges for the moment.
The money that pumped BTC has apparently traveled to Bitcoin Cash, as that cryptocurrency is now up to the $1,800 per single coin range. That’s a gain of more than 15 percent.
The real market action is in Ripple XRP which is up an astonishing 81 percent. Rumors that Ripple is about to announce significant deals with a host of big name corporations is driving the market into the billions in volume. An announcement may arrive in the next day or so as to the partners in the rumored deals.
