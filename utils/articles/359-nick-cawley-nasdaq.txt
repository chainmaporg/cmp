The CME futures contract differs from the recently released CBOE offering, with the new contract worth 5 Bitcoins compared to 1 Bitcoin at the CBOE.

Cryptocurrency Trading Halts and DDOS Attacks

While the coin has made huge gains this year, investors are becoming increasingly worried that the market may have run ahead of itself. BTC has increased in price from around $900 to $19,000 this year while Ethereum (ETH) has soared from $8 to $720 in 2017. Concerns are also being aired that some exchanges are becoming increasingly unreliable with difficult access, verification issues and trading outages commonplace when market volatility spikes. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently blogged that "access to Coinbase services may become degraded or unavailable during times of significant volatility or volume."

Some of the larger exchanges have also reported denial of service (DDOS) attacks, rendering their websites unusable and investors unable to trade.
