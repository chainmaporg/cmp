The stolen $1.8million in ether showed up in Meza's account the day after the kidnapping, Manhattan Defense Attorney Cy Vance Jr said 
The DA said in a statement: 'Video surveillance later obtained from the victim's apartment building showed Meza using the set of keys stolen from the victim to enter the victim's apartment and then leave the apartment holding a box believed to contain the victim's digital wallet.
'Additional records reveal that soon after obtaining the victim's digital wallet, the defendant then transferred approximately $1.8 million in Ether to his own personal account.'
Meza was arrested and charged with Grand Larceny in the First Degree, Kidnapping in the Second Degree, Robbery in the First Degree, Criminal Use of a Firearm in the First Degree, Computer Trespass and other offenses.
He has pleaded not guilty and held on a $1million bond or $500,000 cash bail.
His alleged accomplice has not yet been caught. His identity is not publicly known.
WHAT IS ETHEREUM? 
Ethereum is a technology first developed by Vitalik Buterin, a former Bitcoin programmer in 2013.
After Bitcoin, ether (the currency of Ethereum) is the second most valuable form of digital money.
Ethereum uses a decentralized payment network that allows payments to be sent anonymously across the internet without the need for a bank.  
Transactions made through Ethereum are stored in a blockchain, where they are visible for everyone else in the network to see. 
Since its launch in 2015, the value of the Ether has increased more than 2,300 per cent.
One ether is now worth roughly $700.
