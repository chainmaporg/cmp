While proponents of the digital currency bitcoin argue that its massive price appreciation over the course of 2017 is only the latest step in a rally that will see it multiply several times over from its current levels, another analyst has a far different take: Not only is bitcoin a bubble , it is the biggest bubble of all time.
That view comes courtesy Howard Wang, co-founder of Convoy Investments, who charted bitcoin’s massive gain against other famous periods of speculation, notably the Dutch tulip mania in the 1600s, which had previously reigned as history’s biggest .
Bitcoin’s “price has now gone up over 17 times this year, 64 times over the last three years and superseded that of the Dutch Tulip’s climb over the same time frame,” Wang wrote in a research report.

The move in bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.20%  has been astronomical. It ended 2016 below $1,000 and has recently traded above $17,000, a gain of more than 1,600% on the year. The move has given bitcoin a total value of nearly $280 billion, bigger than all but a dozen components of the S&P 500 SPX, -0.63% Among other factors, recent interest in bitcoin has been fueled by the introduction of bitcoin futures on major exchanges, something analysts said helped to legitimize the space and could enable more institutional money flows.
