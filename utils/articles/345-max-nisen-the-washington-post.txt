Fly Charts: What Weed Can Teach Bitcoin, Iger’s Big Deal: Gadfly
by Max Nisen | Bloomberg December 15, 2017
Good morning! This is Fly Charts, the daily charts-only newsletter from Gadfly; sign up here. From Fox's next steps to subscription-box overload, here are four charts that tell you what you need to know in business today.
And don't miss Chris Hughes on what Fox/Disney means for Sky: "The situation is highly unusual. On Thursday, Rupert Murdoch's Fox agreed to sell most of its business to Disney. So having made a takeover bid for Sky, Murdoch is now breaking up his film and television empire before the first acquisition is completed. The Disney-Fox deal won't void Fox's obligation to press on with its Sky offer, should U.K. regulators approve the takeover. They are due to rule in March, long before the Disney-Fox deal would complete. But Disney's intervention does create alternative scenarios that Sky's deputy chairman, Martin Gilbert, must weigh carefully."
