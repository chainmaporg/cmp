Small-Cap Setup
Small-cap stocks have pulled back again recently, creating another potential opportunity to pick up shares.
PowerShares S&P Small Cap Low Volatility ( XSLV ) is testing support at its 50-day moving average , setting up a chance to buy on a solid bounce off the line. The ETF advanced nearly 6% from a mid-November rebound off the 50-day to its Nov. 30 intraday high. Before that, it rose 8% from a Sept. 11 pullback to a late October peak.
The fund, which tracks the S&P SmallCap 600 Low Volatility Index, has gathered $1.1 billion in assets. It will mark its five-year anniversary in February. The index comprises 120 stocks from the S&P SmallCap 600 index with the lowest realized volatility in the past 12 months.
Financials accounted for the biggest sector weighting as of Dec. 12, at 27% of assets. Industrials and real estate made up about 21% each, while utilities and information technology contributed roughly 7% apiece.
Top holdings included Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance ( ARI ), Minnesota-based utility Allete ( ALE ), El Paso Electric ( EE ), Capstead Mortgage ( CMO ) and J&J Snack Foods ( JJSF ). Allete and El Paso Electric have run up more than 20% each this year.

XSLV's 8.8% year-to-date return through Dec. 12, according to Morningstar Direct, lags the S&P 500's 21.3% return. Its average annual return of 14.9% over the past three years is slightly ahead of the benchmark index's 12.3% gain for the same period.
The ETF carries a 0.25% expense ratio.
Wednesday's pick, First Trust Dow Jones Global Select Dividend ( FGD ), rose 0.3% Wednesday and remains in buy range from a recent bounce off the 50-day line as well as after clearing a shallow-base entry.
