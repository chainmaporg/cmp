NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares gained worldwide on Friday and Wall Street notched closing record highs on U.S. tax legislation optimism, while the U.S. yield curve turned its flattest in a decade after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates this week.
MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.31 percent after a week of central bank meetings that saw the Fed raise U.S. rates yet leave its rate outlook for the coming years unchanged. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England held off on hikes.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 143.08 points, or 0.58 percent, to end at 24,651.74, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 23.8 points, or 0.90 percent, to 2,675.81 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 80.06 points, or 1.17 percent, to 6,936.58.
Wall Street equities closed sharply higher as Republican lawmakers prepared to reveal details of their final tax bill, which is expected to cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.
“It’s meaningful in terms of its impact on shareholders. You’re going to see an increase in stock buybacks, maybe some dividend payouts,” said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston.
Votes on the legislation from the House of Representatives and the Senate are expected next week.
The long-awaited bill has been one of the catalysts for this year’s surge in the stock markets.
Europe’s STOXX 600  closed down 0.19 percent, as a 12.98 percent slump in fashion giant H&M ( HMb.ST ) and a 6.29 percent drop for Italian luxury goods firm Ferragamo ( SFER.MI ) spooked retailers.
In addition, worries over political risk spurred profit-taking. According to EPROM’s weekly data, worries over the national election next year in Italy hit European equity funds with outflows at their highest in over a year.
Emerging market stocks .MSCIEF lost 0.24 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was down 0.42 percent.
Japan's Nikkei stock index .N225 finished down 0.62 percent at its lowest in more than a week, with mobile firms extending a selloff on concerns of increased competition after e-commerce group Rakuten said it aims to become the country's fourth wireless carrier.
