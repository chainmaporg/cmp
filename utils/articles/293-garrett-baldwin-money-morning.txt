Now that we know all of today's price movements, here's what has been moving these cryptocurrencies…
Cryptocurrency Markets Today
On Wednesday, the market capitalization of the global cryptocurrency sector hit $514.79 billion. That figure is now larger than the market capitalization of Warren Buffett's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.A ).
Bitcoin now comprises 53.8% of the global cryptocurrency market.
Top performers from the largest 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization included Ripple (up 67.45%), Cardano (up 61.25%), TRON (up 56.88%), Factom (UP 35.11%), EOS (up 34.41%), Stellar (up 29.38%), BitShares (up 27.63%), Golem (up 21.23%), and Zcash (up 18.99%).
The worst performers from the top 50 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization included Veritaseum (down -10.13%), Litecoin (down -7.56%), Waves (down -7.18%), IOTA (down -5.88%), Tether (down -3.34%), Ardor (down -3.17%), Vertcoin (down -3.04%), and MonaCoin (down -1.44%).
Litecoin Prices Today Retreat
Litecoin has been retreating over the last 48 hours from its record highs.
Considered the "silver" to Bitcoin's "gold," the crypto coin has skyrocketed in price thanks to a media blitz from creator Charlie Lee.
New investors also are pouring into Litecoin, because it's more affordable than buying one whole Bitcoin.
Ethereum Hovers Near $66 Billion Valuation
The price of Ethereum hit $680 as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization approached $66 billion.
However, that figure is down after it hit an all-time high of $752. The cryptocurrency has surged in recent weeks after Bitcoin investor and former hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz predicted that Bitcoin would rise by 200% over the next year.
Despite the huge surge of transactions on the Ethereum network, even co-founder Vitalik Buterin isn't convinced that one can justify the half-trillion-dollar valuation of the global market.
Of course, that isn't stopping millennials from pouring into the crypto space…
