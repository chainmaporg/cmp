We're deep in the heart of Bitcoin madness.
The original cryptocurrency's more than tenfold increase over the past year has thrust the blockchain -based digital currency into Wall Street's face. Notable investors like the Winklevii have been cashing in, as the finance sector wades into Bitcoin futures trading. At the same time, consumers and everyday investors are trying to figure out what Bitcoin actually is and how they can get in on the frenzied action.
Bitcoin isn't the only digital currency garnering mainstream attention. As the volatile but lucrative cryptocurrency has risen from hundreds to thousands to tens of thousands of dollars per digital coin, the rest of the landscape is riding its coattails. The Ethereum blockchain—long viewed as a more viable mainstream platform—and its Ether cryptocurrency have risen in value along with coins like Litecoin, Ripple, and the forked Bitcoin Cash, which Coinbase now supports.
So how can you get some? You'll need to use an exchange to buy and sell the cryptocurrency, and a wallet app to store it securely. If you're in the US and want to quickly buy some Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether, or Litecoin, Coinbase is the most popular and easiest-to-use option. Here's how you get started.
