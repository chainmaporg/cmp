Updates from the Mingo Team
Dear Mingo Community
Thank you for your ongoing support. As you know, we successfully completed our Pre-ICO in October and we are now looking forward to our full ICO in 2018. We are also pleased to announce some exciting updates in this Newsletter.
Since the closure of the Pre-ICO we have invested our time and funds in the ongoing development of MingoMessenger as well as adding new exciting modules which we will be announcing shortly.
Our next challenge is our full ICO in 2018. We will advise you of our launch date in due course. Following the successful completion of the ICO, we will continue with the ongoing strategic and global development of the Company, the development of our enhanced technical product suite which will integrate exciting services and features, as well as well as creating strategic relationships with our partners.
Mingo is further developing the following leading edge solutions:
* MingoMessenger is our unique multi-channel messaging app supporting six channels (Facebook, Twitter, Steem, Discord, Slack, and IRC Cloud) and will deliver other channels in the near future. The unique approach of MingoMessenger is that all contacts, regardless of channel, show up in the same Mingo platform. In Mingo, the message trail between you and your contact can be viewed in one discussion under their name. This eliminates the need to jump between app channels and platforms searching for important communications from your contact — every channel is visible in a single view for each contact in the Mingo app. MingoMessenger 2.0 will be released for beta testing soon and we will send out the new download URLs soon. Mingo also makes it possible to add corporate white label channels for companies and organisations.
* MingoGame is an e-Sports gaming platform. Mingo users can challenge each other to games of skill, paying an entry fee to compete individually or in micro tournaments, using MingoCoin cryptocurrency. We shall be announcing details of this exciting new feature very soon.
* MingoCoin is the base cryptocurrency in the Mingo app and is developed on the secure, trustworthy, and proven distributed public ledger blochchain technology. MingoCoin enables full crypto currency transactions.
* MingoWallet is a multicurrency wallet that supports cryptocurrencies, including MingoCoin, Bitcoin and Ether, as well as traditional currencies. Mingo will derive revenue from commission fees from financial transactions over the MingoMessenger app and the e-sports gaming app. In addition, both sender and receiver are given MingoCoin as a reward for downloading the Mingo app and playing a game.
We are also announcing additions to our team and advisor base; a big welcome to Ciaren Diante, Dr. Paul Ennis, Jillian Godsil and Reuben Godfrey. Check out their profiles on LinkedIn. Come and say hello.
So, we have a lot going on as we head into the holiday period. We shall be in touch soon.
Yours in Mingo
