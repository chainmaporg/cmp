Chain has partnered with leaders in financial services, such as Nasdaq and First Data, to build the next generation of financial services infrastructure. We are building a digital asset platform that enables the creation & transfer of digital assets across organizational lines.

Activities include:
Inventing protocols for financial services infrastructure
Designing distributed data models
Cryptographically securing digital asset transactions
Building secure signing servers
Packaging on-premise transaction validation systems
We look for people who consider themselves to be professionals. This means you have:
Strong written and verbal communication skills
Dedicated work ethic
Emotional intelligence
Passion for diversity
At Chain, we believe our success is based upon our diversity of backgrounds and experiences. We value the contribution of our employees and the potential of job applicants based on merit, competence, creativity, and qualifications. We will never discriminate on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity, religion, color, sexual orientation, age, or disability. We believe that we are building the financial system of the future - and that at the heart of it should be an inclusive culture.
We are a community that enjoys our work. Our beautiful tree house of an office is located in Hayes Valley. We eat lunch together and take company outings. Chain provides competitive salaries, equity, and full benefits.
