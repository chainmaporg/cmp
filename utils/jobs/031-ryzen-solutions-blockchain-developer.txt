Cryptography
Game theory, crypto-economics
We need someone who can read, write and test smart contracts. We have a (mostly) serverless architecture, so IPFS is the database, the Ethereum blockchain is the backend. There are a lot of security considerations for this project and we need somebody who can think through and implement and test secure processes. We like hackers, so if you are a quick learner and creative with technology, we want to talk to you.
This is an opportunity to build the future of knowledge sharing! If you donâ€™t have any experience with Ethereum or IPFS, please put together a project using them on your own and present it to us.
Desired experience:
4+ years of professional software development experience
Startup experience
