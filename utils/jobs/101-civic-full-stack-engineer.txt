Civic’s mission is to provide every person on Earth with a digital identity that they can use to interact privately and securely with the world. We envision a world where people can decide who they want to share their personal information with and what information gets shared.
Led by Vinny Lingham and Jonathan Smith, two visionary founders with entrepreneurial and cybersecurity experience, we have created a revolutionary platform to achieve this based on blockchain technology and have recently conducted one of the most well respected token sales in history!  We sold $33m worth of tokens that will allow us to deliver a Marketplace for transaction of trusted identities. This Marketplace will change both the economics and user experience of how trusted identity is used forever, opening up new use cases for how we  use identity.  For further reference on our token sale and how the ecosystem will work please click here and to read our whitepaper, click here .
