Job Description
What We’re Looking For
Coins is looking for a Product designer to join the team in the Philippines and become a creative leader at the company.  This is a unique opportunity to help shape design standards for a rapidly growing platform that will continue to improve the way millions of users throughout Southeast Asia plug into the modern financial system.  The ideal candidate will form strong, creative convictions about how design will make our users’ lives better and will be fully empowered to follow-through with them.
Key Responsibilities
-Shape design standards that enable consistency of the Coins experience across platforms and across countries in Southeast Asia
-Work with the product team to develop user stories and decide on product flows
-Conduct research, gather data, and speak with customers to form opinions about who our users are and how they should best interact with our products
-Quickly iterate on product mockups and work with developers to turn the mockups into reality
-Continually examine our existing products and propose solutions to key user frustrations
Why This is Exciting
-We are using some of the most futuristic emerging technologies (Bitcoin/Blockchain) to increase financial inclusion for a vastly overlooked population of more than 600 million
-We already have offices in Manila and Bangkok and hope to become a platform for all of Southeast Asia, as one of the primary user advocates, you will have ample opportunity to travel and interact directly with users throughout Southeast Asia
-Given the target audience and global nature of our product, this role comes with unique design challenges, including:
-- How do you create a consistent experience and design aesthetic across users from vastly different cultures?
-- How does a user that’s never owned a bank account expect to interact with their first mobile wallet?
-- What are the existing anti-patterns in the FinTech industry that new users should never have to experience?
-- How do you explain a complicated technical concept like Bitcoin to an unfamiliar user in a way that fosters trust?
-Our team consists of top talent both globally and locally in our target markets.  Our founders are prior entrepreneurs that have experience scaling teams and driving their startups to successful outcomes
-We have received Venture Capital from global thought leaders with expertise in Emerging Markets, FinTech, and Micro-Finance. They have (literally) bought into our vision and play an active role in helping our company achieve its full potential
Minimum Background
-Shareable design portfolio (Behance, Dribbble, personal site) with prior products you’ve worked on
-Experience designing mobile/web products
-Experience working directly with engineers and product managers in the development process
-Experience creating and iterating on mockups and prototypes
-Experience with various user research methodologies and the empathy to form hypotheses about why users behave in certain ways
-Strong communication skills to articulate and elaborate on design decisions
-Based in, or willing to relocate to Metro Manila (Philippines)
How To Stand Out
-Relevant Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Design, Art, Human-Computer Interaction, etc.
-Experience thinking about users in the Philippines and Southeast Asia
-Experience designing FinTech products
-Passion for Bitcoin and Blockchain technologies and an understanding of how they will change the world
-Experience with Agile Product Development processes
-Experience and understanding of Front-End and/or Mobile development
